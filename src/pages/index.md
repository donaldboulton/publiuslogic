        Built with ❤️ and Jamaican Blue Mountain Coffee. PubliusLogic is a collection of tutorials by the Publius on a lot of human subjects.
        Since I have never had anyone work on anything of mine I build my own website's and enjoy
        coding it a lot. The tutorials on this site are surrounding Gatsby, React, ReactHooks, Styled Components and even bluma .css with Styled Components and styled icons. Using React hooks for Forms, Modals, Masonry Gallery Layout's, Google Maps and more. I have Moved from my donboulton.com website build with Jekyll adding React and a Webpack build to my Jekyll site gave me all the tools I needed to Build this Gatsby site. I have lots of ways to contact me within every page, so let me know of any errors, or issues you have with my writings or code.

         Our name was taken from publications of 85 articles in mostly New York papers. The Publius was published anonymously as the - Federalist Papers - Constitution Facts. Including my 15 years extensive studies Of the Books at Large - USA Congressional Reports, also studying the of Notes and Letters from our Founding Fathers as Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, and John Jay. Logic Came from Thomas Paine's book Common Sense. Originally published anonymously, “Common Sense” advocated independence for the American colonies from Britain and is considered one of the most influential pamphlets in American history. Promoting the colonists to seek Independence.

        We believe that good coffee has the power to bring people together.
        That’s why we decided to turn a corner of our shop into a cozy meeting
        space where you can hang out with fellow coffee lovers and learn about
        coffee making techniques. All of the artwork on display there is for
